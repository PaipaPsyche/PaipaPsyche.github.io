<h1 id="coronavirus_outbreak">Outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</h1>
<p>The year 2020 began with a lot of bad news, among them is the high political tension between the US and Iran,
	monstrous fires that threaten a cosniderable part of Australia and its fauna, and the topic of which I am
	going to talk to you today: The spread of the Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. To make a brief introduction to
	 what this new virus means, I cite some official sources that can better explain the situation.</p>

<div style="background-color:#121220">
<q><i>2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a <b>virus</b> (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the
	 cause of an outbreak of  <b>respiratory illness</b> first detected in <b>Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019</b> . Early on,
	 many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting
	 <b>animal-to-person spread</b>. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating
	 <b>person-to-person spread</b> is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people[..]</i></q>

<div style="background-color:#121220">
	<q><i>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to
		 more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory
		  Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a <b>new strain that has not been previously identified
				 in humans.</b></i></q>

<br />
<br />

<q><i>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed
	investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary
	camels to humans. <b>Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</b></i></q>
<br />
<br />

<q ><i>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing
	difficulties. <b>In more severe cases</b>, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney
	 failure and even <b>death</b>.</i></q>

<br />
<br />
<q><i><b>Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread</b> include regular hand washing, covering mouth and
	nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. <b>Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms</b> of respiratory
	illness such as coughing and sneezing.</i></q>

<h3>Twitter as a Global Agent</h3>
<p>Twitter is a social network known to almost everyone since, in addition to being a social network with hundreds
	 of millions of users worldwide, it is a  of mass dissemination tool for topics as current affairs, news, politics, science, and culture among others.</p>
<div style="background-color:#121220">
<q><i>Twitter is a social networking and microblogging
service that allows users to post real time messages,
called tweets. Tweets are short messages, restricted
to 140 characters in length. Due to the nature of this
microblogging service (quick and short messages),
people use acronyms, make spelling mistakes, use
emoticons and other characters that express special
meanings.[..] </i></q>
<p style="font-size:12pt;"> -Taken from <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W11-0705.pdf">Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data. </a><i> Agarwal A. ,Xie B., et al.(2011)</i><p>
</div>
<p>It is important to mention that, for a premature humanity that is learning the power of the Internet, the concept
 of Twitter is experimental: Express an idea with limited characters and make it available to all the people of the world,
  literally, if desired. As a social experiment of mass distribution of opinions, Twitter takes the lead in exposing the true face of the Internet and its
	use as a collective intelligence.</p>

<div style="background-color:#121220">
<q><i>[..] Individually, most Twitter messages are stupefyingly trivial. But the true value of Twitter — and the similarly mundane Dodgeball, a tool for
	reporting your real-time location to friends — is cumulative. The power is in the surprising effects that come from receiving thousands of pings from your posse.
	 And this, as it turns out, suggests where the Web is heading.</i></q>

<h3>Sentiment Analysis Applications</h3>
<p>wikipedia defines <i>sentiment Analysis</i> as :</p>
<div style="background-color:#121220">
<q><i>[..] <b>Sentiment analysis</b> (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of <b>natural language processing</b>, text analysis,
	 computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, <b>quantify</b>, and study affective states and <b>subjective information</b>.</i></q>
<p style="font-size:12pt;"> -Taken from <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/06/st-thompson-4/">Wired</a><p>

</div>
<p>Natural language processing is, in other terms, an area of ​​study in the development of Artificial Intelligence that tells us about the way in which computers can interpret
	human language, creating rules between words and characters in order to assign them some syntactic value. In quantifying these properties, it is easy to notice patterns of association
	between nearby words, very frequent words or the position in which a word is found within a sentence. These patterns are of great value to go one step further in the interpretation
	of language: meaning. If a machine is taught to relate these patterns to any quantity that quantifies some dimension of human feeling, it will be easy to make semasiological associations
	 since in many cases they are evident. For example, in terms like or dislike for reviews made to products, relationships such as the given score and the appearance of the words "bad" and
	 "excellent" are usually found.</p>

<h3>Study on Twitter Opinions about Coronavirus</h3>
<p>One day at work, I started to hear the conversation of two colleagues talking about this new disease caused by coronavirus and I thought: <i>everyone is talking about how the coronavirus is rapidly
	expanding around the world, but very few actually wonder how it is that They got to talk about the coronavirus in the first place. It would be an interesting proposal to see the coronavirus,
	a threat of global stature, as a social phenomenon exposed to the globalization of the opinion generated by the internet.</i></p>
<p>For this study, the source of information will be Twitter, as a way to reflect the world's opinion on a subject of great impact such as the Coronavirus. The idea is to draw relevant conclusions
 about how the world sees this new threat using Sentiment Analysis on Tweets and comparing associated quantities such as the number of likes, retweets and responses. Twitter data is public and extracted using
 Web Scrappers in Python, they are filtered according to their quality and relevance and then processed by sentiment analysis libraries to quantify properties such as subjectivity and polarity (Positive or negative inclination of Tweet) .</p>
<p>Under no circumstances are attempts to plagiarize the work of the sources cited or provide false information. The filter stage of the Tweets is still in development and the poor quality of the information may
	 alter the result slightly, to which the study will be constantly updated to provide more accurate and updated information. Any suggestions on how to improve the study are welcome in my e-mail: <b>davidpaipa03@gmail.com</b><p>
<p>For some reason I can not extract more than one cap of tweets per day, it is probably a restriction that Twitter has to restrict the use of bots on its platform. In any case, I will try to expose the properties
	 of interest in the best possible way, understanding that a limited population is available.</p>

<h1 id="observe_data">Observing Twitter Data</h1>
<p>Making a preliminary exploration of the data, the appearance of the subject is observed as a global trend from the first day of the year 2020. But beyond the frequency with which the tweets appear, the
analysis of sentiment throws relevant data on the nature of the tweets.</p>

<h3>Polarity</h3>
<p>The polarity analysis is scored with the positive and negative impact of keywords within the sentence.</p>

<h3>Impact and resonance</h3>
<p>The Impact analysis is obtained by quantifying the people reached by each tweet, amplifying its polarity according to the Tweet's objectivity.</p>
