<p>The year 2020 began with a lot of bad news, among them is the high political tension between the US and Iran,
	monstrous fires that threaten a cosniderable part of Australia and its fauna, and the topic of which I am
	going to talk to you today: The spread of the Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. To make a brief introduction to
	 what this new virus means, I cite some official sources that can better explain the situation.</p>

<div class="qcent">
<q><i>2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a <b>virus</b> (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the
	 cause of an outbreak of  <b>respiratory illness</b> first detected in <b>Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019</b> . Early on,
	 many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting
	 <b>animal-to-person spread</b>. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating
	 <b>person-to-person spread</b> is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people[..]</i></q>

<h3>Twitter as a Global Agent</h3>
<p>Twitter is a social network known to almost everyone since, in addition to being a social network with hundreds
	 of millions of users worldwide, it is a  of mass dissemination tool for topics as current affairs, news, politics, science, and culture among others.</p>
<div class="qcent">
<q><i>Twitter is a social networking and microblogging
service that allows users to post real time messages,
called tweets. Tweets are short messages, restricted
to 140 characters in length. Due to the nature of this
microblogging service (quick and short messages),
people use acronyms, make spelling mistakes, use
emoticons and other characters that express special
meanings.[..] </i></q>

</div>
<p style="font-size:12pt;"> -Taken from <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W11-0705.pdf">Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data. </a><i> Agarwal A. ,Xie B., et al.(2011)</i><p>

<p>It is important to mention that, for a premature humanity that is learning the power of the Internet, the concept
 of Twitter is experimental: Express an idea with limited characters and make it available to all the people of the world,
  literally, if desired. As a social experiment of mass distribution of opinions, Twitter takes the lead in exposing the true face of the Internet and its
	use as a collective intelligence.</p>

<div class="qcent">
<q><i>[..] Individually, most Twitter messages are stupefyingly trivial. But the true value of Twitter — and the similarly mundane Dodgeball, a tool for
	reporting your real-time location to friends — is cumulative. The power is in the surprising effects that come from receiving thousands of pings from your posse.
	 And this, as it turns out, suggests where the Web is heading.</i></q>

<h3>Sentiment Analysis Applications</h3>
<p>wikipedia defines <i>sentiment Analysis</i> as :</p>
<div class="qcent">
<q><i>[..] <b>Sentiment analysis</b> (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of <b>natural language processing</b>, text analysis,
	 computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, <b>quantify</b>, and study affective states and <b>subjective information</b>.</i></q>

</div>

<p style="font-size:12pt;"> -Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">Wikipedia</a><p>

<p>Natural language processing is, in other terms, an area of ​​study in the development of Artificial Intelligence that tells us about the way in which computers can interpret
	human language, creating rules between words and characters in order to assign them some syntactic value. In quantifying these properties, it is easy to notice patterns of association
	between nearby words, very frequent words or the position in which a word is found within a sentence. These patterns are of great value to go one step further in the interpretation
	of language: meaning. If a machine is taught to relate these patterns to any quantity that quantifies some dimension of human feeling, it will be easy to make semasiological associations
	 since in many cases they are evident. For example, in terms like or dislike for reviews made to products, relationships such as the given score and the appearance of the words "bad" and
	 "excellent" are usually found.</p>

<h3>Study on Twitter Opinions about Coronavirus</h3>
<p>One day at work, I started to hear the conversation of two colleagues talking about this new disease caused by coronavirus and I thought: <i>everyone is talking about how the coronavirus is rapidly
	expanding around the world, but very few actually wonder how it is that They got to talk about the coronavirus in the first place. It would be an interesting proposal to see the coronavirus,
	a threat of global stature, as a social phenomenon exposed to the globalization of the opinion generated by the internet.</i></p>
<p>For this study, the source of information will be Twitter, as a way to reflect the world's opinion on a subject of great impact such as the Coronavirus. The idea is to draw relevant conclusions
 about how the world sees this new threat using Sentiment Analysis on Tweets and comparing associated quantities such as the number of likes, retweets and responses. Twitter data is public and extracted using
 Web Scrappers in Python, they are filtered according to their quality and relevance and then processed by sentiment analysis libraries to quantify properties such as subjectivity and polarity (Positive or negative inclination of Tweet) .</p>
<p>Under no circumstances are attempts to plagiarize the work of the sources cited or provide false information. The filter stage of the Tweets is still in development and the poor quality of the information may
	 alter the result slightly, to which the study will be constantly updated to provide more accurate and updated information. Any suggestions on how to improve the study are welcome in my e-mail: <b>davidpaipa03@gmail.com</b><p>
<p>For some reason I can not extract more than one cap of tweets per day, it is probably a restriction that Twitter has to restrict the use of bots on its platform. In any case, I will try to expose the properties
	 of interest in the best possible way, understanding that a limited population is available.</p>

<p>Making a preliminary exploration of the data, the appearance of the subject is observed as a global trend from the first day of the year 2020. But beyond the frequency with which the tweets appear, the
analysis of sentiment throws relevant data on the nature of the tweets.</p>

<h3>Word Frequency</h3>

<p>An analysis of the tweets is executed: initeligible words, grammatical connectors and other filler words are discarded leaving the really important words as a source of information. The effective range is
limited to words associated with English, as well as the character dictionary is limited to those alphanumeric in Latin alphabet. Below is a graphic representation of the most frequent words found in
the Tweets sample, taking into account that a higher frequency implies greater relevance in the word cloud:
</p>
<div>
<img src="DataImages/wordCloud.png" class="plot" />
</div>
<p>	The illustration speaks for itself. </p>
<h3>Hashtag Frequency</h3>
<p>From the hashtgas used by people, those used in the least relevant tweets are discarded, likewise, only those that make any sense within the context of the coronavirus are preserved. It is expected
	 that the most used hashtag is <b>#coronavirus</b>, but then the other hastags found within the sample are exposed:</p>

<img src="DataImages/hashtags_coronavirus.png" class="plot" />
<p>It is importnat to mention (as you may have suspected) that these are not all of the hashtags retrieved, but are the most relevant (or most frequent) since many of them appeared one time or where
written with terrible ortography. The other <i>ignored</i> hashtags correspond to a <b>12.5%</b> of the total sample, <i>#coronavirus</i> correspond to a <b>37.2%</b> and the other <b>50.3%</b> corresponds to the ones here displayed. </p>
<h3>Polarity</h3>
<p>The polarity analysis is a score that shows the positive and negative effects of keywords within a sentence. The keyword analysis is pre-trained with movie reviews obtained from opinion forums to
	establish a relationship between common words in the expression of an opinion and the feeling generated. This allows you to classify the Tweets given the words they contain in order to determine a
	feeling or polarity for each one. Depending on this polarity value, the tweet is classified as "Good" or "Bad" if it has a strong feeling inclined to either of these two polarities. If the feeling
	 is not relevant, it is classified as "not interesting." Below is how the tweets behaved for a population of approximately 600 users per day who talked about the topic.</p>
<div>
<img src="DataImages/count_coronavirus.png" class="plot" />
</div>
<h3>Impact and resonance</h3>
<p>The Resonance analysis is obtained by quantifying the people reached by each tweet. Measuring this effective population reached, Amplifying the polarity according to the Tweet's objectivity lead to a value called Impact, which talks about the
	positive or negative impact of the topic in social media.</p>
<p> A tweet may reach few people, but with an objective approach and a great polarity value it may create a considerable impact. By the other hand, a tweet may reach many people, but if its a subjective Tweet with few sentiment it might not create a great <i>social echo</i>.</p>

<div>
<img src="DataImages/resonance_coronavirus.png" class="plot" />
</div>
<p>take into account that from the action of 600 users a day a reach of almost 120 thousand individuals was achieved. "Coronavirus" is a concept that spreads from public opinion, knowing that this study was conducted without taking into account publications made
	 by official news sources or any scientific source of information.</p>

 <h3>Propagation and Resistance</h3>
 <p>We are going to quantify the average number of people reached by tweet for each day. This amount is calculated by taking out the resonance rate achieved by tweets made on the same day, thus obtaining
	  a number greater than or equal to one corresponding to the number of possible replicas achieved on average for each tweet made on the subject; This number is the propagation index.</p>

<p>Another number of interest is to quantify how many tweets are left behind given their low subjectivity and neutral polarity. Any Tweet of low impact is considered discarded by the social trend movement
	and its rate with respect to the amount of daily tweets is called the resistance index. This number between zero and one expresses the proportion of tweets that have to be lost from one day to another
	given their low interest rate. The following shows how these indices behave over time and a trend line associated with their behavior.</p>

<img src="DataImages/propagation_coronavirus.png" class="plot" />



<h3>Subjectivity Analysis</h3>
<p>The sentiment analysis model recognizes keywords to determine the degree of subjectivity of a statement. This applied to the tweets quantifies how close they are to be a fact or an opinion according to the vocabulary used in their writing. To determine the
	 propagation of opinions and facts, the proportion of subjective tweets, resistance and resonance by date is taken into account. With this, there is a value corresponding to the volume of tweets with transcendence (echo) classified as fact or opinion.</p>
<img src="DataImages/opinion_coronavirus.png" class="plot" />
<p>By increasing the daily rate of objective tweets using the propagation index and accumulating this value by dates given the persistence in the network of tweets, a new amount arises corresponding to the propagation of objectivity and subjectivity.
	These amounts correspond to the potential per day of each tweet to generate responses in each of these categories according to objectivity; it is measured in the same units as resonance, as it is also a metric for spreding. Focusing specifically on opinions, one can quantify how many opinions are propagated by each equally
	propagated fact: this rate is the subjectivity persistence.</p>
